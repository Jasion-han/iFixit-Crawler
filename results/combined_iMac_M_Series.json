Pretty nifty use of what might otherwise be empty space!\nApple's obsession with audio quality shows throughout their product lineup, as recent teardowns from headphones to AirTags have proven.\nSpeaking of air, our mid-tier iMac comes with two small fans (vs. just one in the base model). This marks the first dual-fan setup in an M1 machine—which ought to be more than enough, considering how well the completely fanless M1 MacBook Air seems to perform with the exact same chip.",

But why two of them? And why the strange placement in the middle of the enclosure?\nOrdinarily, we'd expect to find a single CR2032 battery protecting the NVRAM, like on previous iMacs.\nBest guess: The new iMac design was too thin for a CR2032 on the main board. That's right—they couldn't squeeze in the battery from an AirTag. So Apple instead used two half-height CR2016s, and squirreled them away over here for clearance.\nCloser inspection reveals a camouflaged stretch-release adhesive pull tab under the battery board—the same sort of stuff that secures iPhone batteries.\nWe're fans of this stretchy adhesive when the alternative is poking and prying at a glued-down smartphone battery, but its use here seems ... odd.\nOnce again, thinness suggests an answer: This is a wafer-thin board, set in place with a vanishingly thin strip of adhesive.\nYou can't fully remove or replace either battery while the board is glued in place. Fortunately replacements shouldn't be frequent, but they'll certainly be inconvenient.",

Each Touch ID sensor seems to be paired to its original keyboard.\nThat's not a total surprise: Touch ID sensors have been cryptographically paired to their original hardware for years. But these Touch ID peripherals are new, so we kept testing:\nTwo iMacs, one keyboard: once a keyboard is paired to an iMac, it must be unpaired in order to be paired to another iMac.

Plus, the lack of large exposed capacitors inside the iMac itself (like we've seen in previous generations) means you'll have a safer time poking around in there.\nOn the other hand, no more capacitor swaps—you’re not getting inside this thing without destroying it.\nThe innards look similar to a standard Apple MacBook power supply, albeit with a network cable passing through.\nThe tiny ethernet board is likely strengthening and piping the internets through the black wire bunch.\nRed wires feed power into the not-Magsafe magnetic umbilical cord.\nThe power supply can pump out a healthy 143 watts, but in our testing, the iMac only draws about 60 watts at most.
