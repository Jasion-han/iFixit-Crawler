          "content": "The logic board is the hub for the vast majority of a MacBook’s functionality.. Any number of the small components on the board may have failed or become damaged.\n\nLogic board fault is a safe assumption of cause if nothing else on this page has worked.. Check for obvious signs of a board issue - burned or cracked components, liquid residue, corrosion or bend.\n\nIf there are signs of liquid, there’s still hope your Mac can be resurrected.Replacing the logic board is often the most practical solution for a DIYer whose board has failed.. If your board is at fault, and you need data, you still have options.If you’re feeling especially curious, the tiny components on the board can be repaired with microsoldering.\n\nIt is an art unto itself, but a worthy endeavor for those who are adventurous.. Check out this intro!. If you can't do this sort of repair yourself, give your local repair shop a call and see if they can help.\n\nEven if they can’t, they may be able to recommend someone who can."
